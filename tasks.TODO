To fix:
 ☐ argument expressions need to be assigned to a local var
 ☐ parallel array operations need to be specialized
 ☐ specialize parallel operation instances for the other data-structures where it makes sense
 ☐ implement all the basic parallel operations
 ✔ add combiner support @done (13-03-01 17:02)
 ☐ fix exception handling
 ☐ replace volatile reads with unsafe calls // In progress

Todo items:
 ☐ write a comprehensive suite of unit tests
 ☐ write a comprehensive suite of microbenchmark regression tests
 ☐ implement HashNode and parallel hash tables
 ☐ implement LockNode and port hash tries to use it
 ☐ an interface for thread pools and their configuration
 ☐ value/implicit class conversion to support parallel operations - an API to convert between normal and parallel operations
 ☐ verify performance on AMD platforms, UltraSPARC, multi-socket Intels
 ☐ design an API for scheduler configuration (number of threads, pool, chunking size, schedule, stealing strategy, etc.)

Bigger applications:
 ☐ PageRank
 ☐ K-means
 ☐ Barnes-Hut
 ☐ Smith-Waterman
 ☐ Mandelbrot set computation
 ☐ genetic algorithm optimization
 ☐ flocking
 ☐ some linear algebra applications
 ☐ raytracing
 ☐ adjoint convolution
 ☐ finding anagrams
 ☐ brute-force TSP
 ☐ triangular matrix multiplication

Features to add:
 ☐ allow asynchronous execution
